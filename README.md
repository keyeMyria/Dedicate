# dedicate

A cross-platform mobile application, used to help motivate & dedicate yourself towards completing daily, weekly, monthly, & yearly tasks.

## Support This Project

Purchase the app on the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store to help further the development of this application.

## How It Works
Create tasks that you'd like to track & complete. For example, you could create a task called "pushups", and any time you'd like to do some pushups throughout the day, you could track how many pushups you did. Or, you could create a task called "ate something", and any time you ate something, you could track how many calories, carbs, fats, sugars, & proteins you consumed. It's up to you. You create the task, you provide the input fields to track, and then you choose when to track your tasks.

## Tracking Tasks
After creating tasks & completing them on a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly basis, you can view your progress for each task. Charts are provided so you can analyze patterns and correct behavior over time. I would consider this the most important aspect of the application, since it gives you an overview of how you have performed over time, which can help motivate and further dedicate yourself towards completing your tasks more efficiently.
